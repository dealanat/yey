    <p>I was bullied for being gay, but that bullying became my strength and resilience. It inspired me to rise above the hate and make a positive impact in the world. Despite the challenges I faced during my school days, I embraced my true self and pursued my passion for teaching. Now, as a teacher, I strive to create a safe and inclusive environment for all students, spreading love, acceptance, and knowledge. My journey from a victim of bullying to an advocate for change is a testament to the power of standing up and making a difference. Put your trust in me when I say that I am capable of creating a social change.</p>
