    <p>As a future teacher, I won’t just only teach students with a specific subject nor just encode their grades. I will be a one-call-away teacher, not a teacher everyone fears that asking for help will be a hard thing for my students. As a future educator, I am aware of my pivotal role to create social change: bullying is one of the things students nowadays face where one student thinks highly of themselves in comparison to another student. To create a change, even just a little change, I plan to create an environment where every student of mine feels safe. Our classroom will be their second home; unheard students will be heard and unseen students will be seen. Today, my plan seems to be small, you might think that it won’t create a change but trust me, put your trust in me when I say that I am capable of creating a social change.</p>
